**Security Report: Analysis of 72GB Outgoing Bandwidth Spike**

Submitted by: Exril  
Date: November 10, 2024
Server: Ubuntu 22.04  

---

### Incident Overview

We detected an unexpected increase of approximately 70GB in outgoing bandwidth from our server. Following a thorough investigation, here are the key findings and actions taken.

### Investigation Summary

After analyzing the server’s activity and logs, we determined the following:

- **DDoS Activity**  
  No DDoS activity was detected. Our analysis showed no signs of incoming or outgoing DDoS traffic, ruling out this as a cause.

- **Server Exposure and Unauthorized Access**  
  IP and port configurations were verified as secure, and no indicators of exposure-related traffic were identified.

- **Malware and Rootkit Scans**  
  Scans using `chkrootkit` and `rkhunter` found no malware or rootkits, confirming the server’s integrity.

- **Lavalink Service Analysis**  
  Logs indicate that our Lavalink music streaming service likely contributed to the spike, possibly due to a memory leak or configuration issue. Further investigation into its resource usage is ongoing.

### Actions Taken

1. **Enhanced Security**  
   - Passwords were reset for added protection.
   - TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is enabled, providing security to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**  
   - Network monitoring has been enhanced to detect and alert on unusual traffic spikes.
   - Automated log auditing has been configured to flag potential issues in real-time.

3. **Lavalink Review**  
   - We are actively investigating Lavalink’s memory and bandwidth usage.
   - Temporary usage limits have been applied to Lavalink to prevent further abnormal spikes.

### Cybersecurity Measures

- **Firewall Adjustments**: Outgoing traffic is restricted to essential services only.
- **Regular Security Scans**: Routine scans will continue to detect potential security risks.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures data in transit and at rest is secure.

### Recommendations

- **Regular Review of High-Bandwidth Applications**: Regularly monitor applications like Lavalink to optimize configurations and detect memory leaks.
- **Proactive Traffic Monitoring**: Continue enhanced monitoring and alerting for abnormal traffic.
- **Frequent Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits, including vulnerability assessments.

### Conclusion

This analysis concludes that the outgoing traffic spike was not due to a DDoS attack, malware, or exposure. Lavalink was identified as the likely cause, and measures have been implemented to secure the server and manage network usage.
